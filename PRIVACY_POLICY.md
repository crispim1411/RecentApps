### 🚨 Prominent Disclosure Regarding Accessibility Services

To provide its core functionality (shortcut for recent apps), RecentApps uses the **Android Accessibility API**.

**What this means for you:**
*   **Purpose:** RecentApps uses the Accessibility Service solely to detect a **long-press gesture** on the system's Home button or Gesture Navigation Bar.
*   **Action:** When this gesture is detected, the app performs a system action to open the "Recent Applications" screen.
*   **Data Collection & Sharing:** RecentApps **does not collect, store, or share** any personal or sensitive data through the Accessibility API. We do not monitor your screen content, log your keystrokes, or track your notifications.
*   **User Consent:** This service is only activated if you explicitly grant permission in your device's Accessibility settings. You can revoke this permission at any time.
